# ARTTECH 4136-1: Experimental Game Lab
## Final Project
For my final project for the course, I decided to create a simple RPG game using JavaScript.  
The game is built on and developed from a foundation work - a tutorial project of learning HTML5 games [Udemy tutorial](https://www.udemy.com/how-to-program-games/learn/v4/overview).
